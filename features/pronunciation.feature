Feature: structured data
  In order to provide more consistent language information
  As a language learner
  I want to provide more structured data in my cards

Background:
  Given I am logged in and have created a deck

#Scenario: pronunciation can be shown on front of card if set
#  Given I have a deck where the pronunciation is shown on front
#  When I review a card
#  Then I should see the pronunciation on the front
#
#Scenario: pronunciation can be shown on back of card if set
#  Given I have a deck where the pronunciation is shown on back
#  When I review a card
#  Then I should see the pronunciation on the back
#
#Scenario: pronunciation will not be shown if set
#  Given I have a deck where the pronunciation is not shown
#  When I review a card
#  Then I should not see the pronunciation on the back
#  And I should not see the pronunciation on the front
